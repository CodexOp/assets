    "description": "zkSVM is a powerful technology that combines the speed and security boost of zero-knowledge cryptography with the standardization of coding in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It provides an extra shield to protect the security of transactions, which is particularly important given the major drawbacks of Ethereum, such as difficult scalability and high transaction costs. With zkSVM, solutions can leverage this technology to deliver superior network outcomes, creating a more secure and transparent future for blockchain applications.",
